## Zae/LaraPress

A set of models to use with Laravel's Eloquent to query a Wordpress database.

### Sanity

These models fix a lot of quirks in the names of the columns in the tables to provide a more consistent experience.

### Read-Only

I recommend only using these models for reading, the right columns are not automatically set when creating rows.
This should be done manually.

### TODO

+ Create models for the taxonomy tables.
+ Create a better create experience.
+ Create scopes
